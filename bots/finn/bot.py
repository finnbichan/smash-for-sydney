bots/finn/bot.py

RL-trained bot, following this repo's Bot interface (see bots/bot.py):
subclass Bot, implement fight(gamestate), which is called once per frame
and should only set self.controller inputs - no return value.

Usage in arena.py, same pattern as the other bots:

    from bots.finn.bot import RLBot
    player1 = RLBot()
    player2 = Example(melee.Character.KIRBY)
    fight(melee.Stage.RANDOM_STAGE, [player1, player2])

Loads weights from checkpoints/model_final.zip by default (see
bots/finn/train.py for how that checkpoint is produced). Pass a different path
via the checkpoint_path argument if needed.
