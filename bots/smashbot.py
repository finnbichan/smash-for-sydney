    That method's first line reads ``if action == Action.UNKNOWN_ANIMATION``,
    but libmelee removed the ``UNKNOWN_ANIMATION`` member from its ``Action``
    enum without updating this reference, so *any* call raises AttributeError.
    SmashBot calls is_bmove() every frame (via the Punish/Juggle tactics), so
    without this it crashes on the first in-game frame.

    We only patch when the member is genuinely missing, so a future fixed
    libmelee is left untouched. The replacement is libmelee's own logic with
    the dangling sentinel check dropped (an unrecognized action can't equal a
    non-existent enum member anyway).
